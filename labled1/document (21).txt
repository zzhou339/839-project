Why Mrs. <name>General Talboys</name> first made up her mind to pass the winter of 1859 at Rome I never clearly understood.  To myself she explained her purposes, soon after her arrival at the Eternal City, by declaring, in her own enthusiastic manner, that she was inspired by a burning desire to drink fresh at the still living fountains of classical poetry and sentiment.  But I always thought that there was something more than this in it.  Classical poetry and sentiment were doubtless very dear to her; but so also, I imagine, were the substantial comforts of Hardover Lodge, the General’s house in Berkshire; and I do not think that she would have emigrated for the winter had there not been some slight domestic misunderstanding.  Let this, however, be fully made clear,—that such misunderstanding, if it existed, must have been simply an affair of temper.  No impropriety of conduct has, I am very sure, ever been imputed to the lady.  The General, as all the world knows, is hot; and Mrs. <name>Talboys</name>, when the sweet rivers of her enthusiasm are unfed by congenial waters, can, I believe, make herself disagreeable.
