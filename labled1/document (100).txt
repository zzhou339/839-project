Like all the recent novels in this list (69-73), Lord of the Flies owes much of its dark power and impetus to the second world war, in which Golding served as a young naval officer. His experiences at Walcheren in 1944 nurtured an appetite for quasi-medieval extremes, mixing fiction and philosophy, which is not always a recipe for success in novels. However, Lord of the Flies remains both universal and yet profoundly English, with nods to Defoe, <name>Stevenson</name> and <name>Jack London</name> (2, 24 and 35 in this series).

By the 1950s, now teaching at a boys’ grammar school, <name>Golding</name> was struggling to make his way as a novelist, having had a volume of poems published in 1934. His wife, <name>Ann</name>, who played a crucial role in his creative life, suggested RM Ballantyne’s Coral Island as a source of inspiration. The upshot: a post-apocalyptic, dystopian survivor-fantasy about a bunch of pre-teen and teenage boys on a remote tropical island. But this is a far cry from the world of Robinson Crusoe or Long John Silver.
