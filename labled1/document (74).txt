In Aspects of the Novel, <name>EM Forster</name> wrote: "The final test of a novel will be our affection for it, as it is the test of our friends, of anything else that we cannot define." He might have been writing about <name>W Somerset Maugham</name>'s masterpiece, Of Human Bondage. For English readers, this is a Bildungsroman we mostly first encounter as adolescents. It earns its place in this list for the edgy economy of its dark, often cruel narrative more than its style (prosaic) or its humanity (tormented). <name>Maugham</name>'s unforgettable portrait of <name>Philip Carey</name> is one that teenagers, typically, will ingest like junkies, not least because <name>Maugham</name> poured so much of himself into the plot of the novel and its strangely sympathetic protagonist. Perhaps not since <name>David Copperfield</name>, an obvious inspiration (No 15 in this series), had an English writer mined his own life so explicitly or so ruthlessly.

<name>Philip Carey</name> is an orphan hungry for love and experience. Like <name>Maugham</name>, who was a homosexual with a bad stammer, he is afflicted with a disabling deformity, a club foot. Raised by his clergyman uncle, the boy is imprisoned in late-Victorian vicarage life dreaming of his release from bondage, and praying to an indifferent God to have his disability healed.
