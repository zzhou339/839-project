In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, <name>Elizabeth</name> wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. <name>Bennet</name>, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish <name>Jane</name>'s week, could not bring herself to receive hem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to <name>Elizabeth</name>'s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. <name>Bennet</name> sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added that, if Mr. <name>Bingley</name> and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. -- Against staying longer, however, <name>Elizabeth</name> was positively resolved -- nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. <name>Bingley</name>'s carriage immediately.
