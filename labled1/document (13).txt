She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice, and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted <name>John</name>'s invitation. Mrs. <name>Cavendish</name> gave me some tea, and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always stimulating, and I described, in a humorous manner, certain incidents of my Convalescent Home, in a way which, I flatter myself, greatly amused my hostess. <name>John</name>, of course, good fellow though he is, could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.
At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French window near at hand:
"Then you'll write to the Princess after tea, Alfred? I'll write to <name>Lady Tadminster</name> for the second day, myself. Or shall we wait until we hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal, <name>Lady Tadminster</name> might open it the first day, and Mrs. <name>Crosbie</name> the second. Then there's the Duchess--about the school fete."
