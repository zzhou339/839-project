<name>Hawthorne</name>'s tale has a stark simplicity. In the 17th-century town of Boston, a young woman, <name>Hester Prynne</name>, is publicly disgraced for committing adultery and giving birth to an illegitimate child, a girl named <name>Pearl</name>. Forced to wear a scarlet "A", <name>Hester</name> slowly redeems herself in the eyes of Puritan society. Over many years, she challenges the two men in her life – her husband and her lover – with the dark truth of their emotional responsibilities and failures, while at the same time wrestling with her own sinful nature. After seven long years of painful rehabilitation, she emerges as a strong, inspiring woman, while the pastor, <name>Arthur Dimmesdale</name>, who seduced her dies of shame. <name>Hester</name>, too, eventually dies and is buried near Dimmesdale under a tombstone marked with a simple "A".
