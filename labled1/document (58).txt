Once on a time there was a boy named <name>Jack</name>, and one morning he started to go and seek his fortune.

He hadn't gone very far before he met a cat.

"Where are you going, <name>Jack</name>?" said the cat.

"I am going to seek my fortune."

"May I go with you?"

"Yes," said <name>Jack</name>, "the more the merrier."

So on they went, <name>Jack</name> and the cat.

They went a little farther and they met a dog.

"Where are you going, <name>Jack</name>?" said the dog.
