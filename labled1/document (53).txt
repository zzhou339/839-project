That night at dipper, <name>Scarlett</name> went through the motions of presiding over the table in her mother’s absence, but her mind was in a ferment over the dreadful news she had heard about <name>Ashley</name> and <name>Melanie</name>. Desperately she longed for her mother’s return from the Slatterys’, for, without her, she felt lost and alone. What right had the Slatterys and their everlasting sickness to take <name>Ellen</name> away from home just at this time when she, Scarlett, needed her so much?
　　Throughout the dismal meal, <name>Gerald</name>’s booming voice battered against her ears until she thought she could endure it no longer. He had forgotten completely about his conversation with her that afternoon and was carrying on a monologue about the latest news from Fort Sumter, which he punctuated by hammering his fist on the table and waving his arms in the air. <name>Gerald</name> made a habit of dominating the conversation at mealtimes, and usually <name>Scarlett</name>, occupied with her own thoughts, scarcely heard him; but tonight she could not shut out his voice, no matter how much she strained to listen for the sound of carriage wheels that would herald <name>Ellen</name>’s return.
