In the five years between the publication of his first novel, This Side of Paradise (1920) and his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby (1925), <name>F Scott Fitzgerald</name> experienced the kind of literary success that can only happen in America. <name>Fitzgerald</name> not only coined the term "the jazz age", he lived and wrote about it with the hedonistic delirium expressed in his second novel, The Beautiful and Damned (1922). "I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the 'impossible' come true," he wrote later. His career as the celebrity spokesman for the inter-war generation brought him money, fame, and the love of women. Looking back, he remembered that "it seemed a romantic business to be a successful literary man".

The "jazz" side of Gatsby, amply represented by <name>Baz Luhrmann</name>'s movie, remains seductive. The plot, ripped from the pages of a tabloid and crossed with a romantic novelette, has the potency of cheap music.
