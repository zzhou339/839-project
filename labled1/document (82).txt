Seven years after the publication of Robinson Crusoe, the great Tory essayist and poet <name>Jonathan Swift</name> – inspired by the Scriblerus club, whose members included <name>John Gay</name> and <name>Alexander Pope</name> – composed a satire on travel narratives that became an immediate bestseller.In its afterlife as a classic, <name>Gulliver</name>’s Travels works on many levels. First, it’s a masterpiece of sustained and savage indignation, “furious, raging, obscene”, according to <name>Thackeray</name>. <name>Swift</name>’s satirical fury is directed against almost every aspect of early 18th-century life: science, society, commerce and politics. Second, stripped of <name>Swift</name>’s dark vision, it becomes a wonderful travel fantasy for children, a perennial favourite that continues to inspire countless versions, in books and films. Finally, as a polemical tour de force, full of wild imagination, it became a source for Voltaire, as well as the inspiration for a Telemann violin suite, <name>Philip K Dick<name>’s science-fiction story The Prize Ship, and, perhaps most influential of all, <name>George Orwell</name>’s Animal Farm.
