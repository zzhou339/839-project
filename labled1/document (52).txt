So far, on this list, with the possible exception of <name>Alice</name> in Wonderland (No 18 in this series), Heart of Darkness is probably the title that has aroused, and continues to arouse, most literary critical debate, not to say polemic. This is partly because the story it tells has the visceral simplicity of great myth, and also because the book takes its narrator (Charles Marlow), and the reader, on a journey into the heart of Africa.

Our encounter with <name>Marlow</name>'s life-changing journey begins on the Thames in London, the great imperial capital, with his recollection of "the uttermost ends of the Earth". With brilliant economy, <name>Conrad</name> transports him to Congo on a quest that the writer himself undertook as a young man. There, working for the shadowy, but all-powerful "Company", <name>Marlow</name> hears of Mr <name>Kurtz</name>, who is described as a first-class Company servant. Once in the dark continent, <name>Marlow</name> is sent upriver to make contact with <name>Kurtz</name>, who is said to be very ill, and also to safeguard the security of the Inner Station.
