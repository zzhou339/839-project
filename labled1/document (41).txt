Mr <name>Utterson</name> the lawyer was a quiet， serious man． He was shy with strangers and afraid of showing his feelings． Among friends， however， his eyes shone with kindness and goodness．And， although this goodness never found its way into his conversation， it showed itself in his way of life．He did not allow himself many enjoyable things in life． He ate and drank simply and， although he enjoyed the theatre，he had not been to a play for twenty years． However， he was gentler towards other men’ s weaknesses，and was always ready to help rather than blame them． As a lawyer， he was often the last good person that evil-doers met on their way to prison，or worse． These people often carried with them memories of his politeness and fairness．

Mr <name>Utterson</name>'s best friend was a distant cousin calledRichard Enfield，who was well known as a fun-loving ‘man about town’．Nobody could understand why they were friends， as they were different from each other in every way．They often took long walks together，however， marching through the streets of London in companionable silence．
