The Prime of Miss <name>Jean Brodie</name> is probably the shortest novel on this list, a sublime miracle of wit and brevity, and a Scots classic that’s a masterclass in narrative construction and the art of “less is more”. The action centres on the romantic, fascinating, comic and ultimately tragic schoolmistress <name>Jean Brodie</name> who will, in the most archetypal sense, suffer for the sin of hubris, her excessive self-confidence. At first, her ideas about beauty and goodness, her mysterious glamour and charm will dazzle and seduce her girls – “the crème de la crème” – at the Marcia Blaine School, but in the end the same gifts will cause her downfall. “Give me a girl at an impressionable age,” she boasts, “and she is mine for life.” Eventually that prediction will be fulfilled in the saddest way imaginable.

It is, as <name>Miss Brodie</name> says, “nineteen-thirty-six. The age of chivalry is dead.” The novel’s theme, deftly laid out in a narrative that flashes backwards and forwards, to and from the 1930s, is the education of six wonderfully distinctive, heartless and romantic 10-year-old girls and the covert classroom drama that leads to Miss <name>Brodie</name>’s “betrayal”, her peremptory dismissal from Marcia Blaine by her great enemy, the headmistress, Miss <name>Mackay</name>. That, of course, has nothing to do with school, and everything to do with sex, and the art teacher, <name>Teddy Lloyd</name>, with whom Miss <name>Brodie</name> (defiantly in her “prime”) is hopelessly in love.
