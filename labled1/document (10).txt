Someone tapped <name>Steve</name>'s shoulder. Startled, he whirled around. A woman stood there, just behind him, staring at him insolently. She was tall, as tall as <name>Steve</name> himself, with her close-cropped blond hair peeking out around the edges of a black cap. She wore what looked to <name>Steve</name> like a glossy black Martian sand-cape which she let fall straight down behind her so that it almost brushed the floor. Under it, she wore a brief pair of shorts, also black, and a halter. She was muscular in that lithe, feminine way which had grown so popular in the twenty-second centuryâ€”the century which had finally seen women come abreast of men in all sporting activities and surpass them in some which required special grace and lithe-limbed skill.
"I hope you found whatever you're looking for," she said. She spoke with a complete lack of warmth which startled <name>Steve</name> for the second time in a few moments.
She was a beautiful woman, he realized, but she looked so completely incongruous among the coveralled men that Steve found himself whistling softly. "I never expected to find a girl here," he admitted. "Not on this expedition."
