<name>Jan</name> and <name>Katrina</name> are Dutch children. They live in a little blue house.
Their house is near a big, brown windmill.
The roof of their house is made of red tile.
Near the chimney is a big storkâ€™s nest.
It is made of sticks and straw.
<name>Jan</name> and <name>Katrina</name> like to watch the storks.
They are glad when the little storks peep out of the nest.
