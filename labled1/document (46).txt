<name>John McGahern</name> was a great Irish writer among a brilliant generation that included the playwright <name>Brian Friel</name> and the poets <name>Michael Longley</name> and <name>Seamus Heaney</name>. Equally gifted as a writer of short stories, his finest novels (a small oeuvre) include The Dark and That They May Face the Rising Sun. His influence lives on in the work of Colm Tóibín, who once described him as “the Irish novelist everyone should read”.

Amongst Women, a title derived from the words of the Hail Mary in the Roman Catholic rosary, is <name>McGahern</name>’s masterpiece, uniting all the dominant themes of his work in a single, deeply affecting family drama. Its characteristically limpid opening sentence – “As he weakened, <name>Moran</name> became afraid of his daughters” – encapsulates the main theme. This will be the story of an IRA veteran facing up to approaching death at home in the bosom of his family. His wife, <name>Rose</name>, and their three daughters who love and fear their father, now care for him as his health fails and the shadows draw on. As so often in Irish life, it is the drumbeat of the past that continues to torment his final days.
