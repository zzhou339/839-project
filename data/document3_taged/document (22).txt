He occasionally availed himself of the permission the great man had given him to write to him. Long, high-worded, stilted letters the poor boy wrote and rewrote and copied. But never a line did he have in reply from the gay deceiver. The other boys in the garrison sneered at him, because he sacrificed in this unrequited affection for a politician the time which they devoted to Monongahela, hazard, and high-low-jack. Bourbon, euchre, and poker were still unknown. But one day <name>Nolan</name> had his revenge. This time <name>Burr</name> came down the river, not as an attorney seeking a place for his office, but as a disguised conqueror. He had defeated I know not how many district-attorneys; he had dined at I know not how many public dinners; he had been heralded in I know not how many Weekly Arguses, and it was rumored that he had an army behind him and an empire before him. It was a great day¡ªhis arrival¡ªto poor <name>Nolan</name>. <name>Burr</name> had not been at the fort an hour before he sent for him. That evening he asked <name>Nolan</name> to take him out in his skiff, to show him a canebrake or a cotton-wood tree, as he said,¡ªreally to seduce him; and by the time the sail was over, <name>Nolan</name> was enlisted body and soul. From that time, though he did not yet know it, he lived as A Man Without a Country.
