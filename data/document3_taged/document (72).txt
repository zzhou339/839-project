
After she had the robes tucked around her she took another look at the woman who sat beside her on the back seat. She had met Mrs. <name>Peters</name> the year before at the county fair, and the thing she remembered about her was that she didn't seem like a sheriff's wife. She was small and thin and didn't have a strong voice. Mrs. <name>Gorman</name>, sheriff's wife before <name>Gorman</name> went out and <name>Peters</name> came in, had a voice that somehow seemed to be backing up the law with every word. But if Mrs. <name>Peters</name> didn't look like a sheriff's wife, <name>Peters</name> made it up in looking like a sheriff. He was to a dot the kind of man who could get himself elected sheriff--a heavy man with a big voice, who was particularly genial with the law-abiding, as if to make it plain that he knew the difference between criminals and non-criminals. And right there it came into Mrs. <name>Hale</name>'s mind, with a stab, that this man who was so pleasant and lively with all of them was going to the <name>Wrights</name>' now as a sheriff.
