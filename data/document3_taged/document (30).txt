In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old <name>Simon Wheeler</name>, and inquired after my friend's friend, <name>Leonidas W. Smiley</name>, as requested to do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that <name>Leonidas W. Smiley</name> is a myth; and that my friend never knew such a personage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked old <name>Wheeler</name> about him, it would remind him of his infamous <name>Jim Smiley</name>, and he would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, it succeeded.
