"All right," I said; but I did not think it was all right. As a near-sighted man learns by enforced observation to recognize persons at a distance when the face is not visible to the normal eye, so the man with a bad memory learns, almost unconsciously, to listen carefully and report accurately. My memory is bad; but I had not had time to forget that Mr. <name>Brewster</name> Brede had told me that afternoon that he had three children, at present left in the care of his mother-in-law, while he and Mrs. <name>Brede</name> took their summer vacation.
