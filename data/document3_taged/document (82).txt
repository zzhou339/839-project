
The <name>Red Un</name> was very red; even his freckles were red rather than copper-coloured. And he was more prodigal than most kings, for he had two crowns on his head. Also his hair grew in varying directions, like a wheatfields after a storm. He wore a coat without a tail, but with brass buttons to compensate, and a celluloid collar with a front attached. It was the <name>Red Un</name>'s habit to dress first and wash after, as saving labour; instead of his neck he washed his collar.
