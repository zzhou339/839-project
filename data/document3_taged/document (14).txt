The <name>Red Un</name> was the <name>Chief Engineer</name>'s boy and rather more impressive than the  <name>Chief</name>, who was apt to decry his own greatness. It was the <name>Red Un</name>'s duty to look after the <name>Chief</name>, carry in his meals, make his bed, run errands, and remind him to get his hair cut now and then. It was the <name>Red Un</name>'s pleasure to assist unassumingly in the surveillance of that part of the ship where the great god, Steam, ruled an underworld of trimmers and oilers and stokers and assistant engineers--and even, with reservations, the <name>Chief</name>. The <name>Red Un</name> kept a sharp eye on the runs and read the <name>Chief</name>'s log daily--so much coal in the bunkers; so much water in the wells; so many engine-room miles in twenty-four hours--which, of course, are not sea miles exactly, there being currents and winds, and God knows what, to waste steam on.
