In 1855, a young American poet named <name>Walt Whitman<\name> announced, with typical gusto, that “the United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem”, and made good on this claim in a landmark collection of poems, Leaves of Grass, transforming America’s literary imagination for ever. When, exactly 100 years later, <name>Jack Kerouac<\name> began to hammer out the typescript of his own masterpiece, he was consciously responding to <name>Whitman<\name>’s challenge “to express the inexpressible”. This would become <name>Kerouac<\name>’s lifelong ambition and it expressed itself as On the Road. The book would be an ur-text for the <name>James Dean<\name> decade.
