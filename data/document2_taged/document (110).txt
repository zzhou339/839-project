Sister <name>Carrie<\name> is one of several novels in this series that address the American dream, and it does so in a radical spirit of naturalism that rejected the Victorian emphasis on morality. In some ways it's crude and heavy-handed, blazing with coarse indignation, but in its day it was, creatively speaking, a game-changer. Later, America's first Nobel laureate, <name>Sinclair Lewis<\name>, said that <name>Dreiser<\name>'s powerful first novel "came to housebound and airless America like a great free Western wind, and to our stuffy domesticity gave us the first fresh air since <name>Mark Twain<\name> and <name>Whitman<\name>".
