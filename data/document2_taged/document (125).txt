But it was <name>Edgar Allan Poe<\name>, born 1809, who signals the beginning of what would become a great Anglo-American literary dialogue. <name>Poe<\name> was original in ways that <name>Irving<\name> and <name>Fenimore Cooper<\name> never were. As well as being the first American writer to attempt living exclusively by his pen, he is also the archetype of the romantic literary artist. <name>Henry Miller<\name>, <name>Jack Kerouac<\name>, <name>William S Burroughs<\name>, and even <name>Hunter S Thompson<\name> all owe something to Edgar Allan Poe. His nomadic, boho style and tortured, exigent career continue to exercise a powerful allure on any young American writers who see themselves as outsiders.
